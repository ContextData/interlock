"""One derivation of what an SQL request touches, for enforcement and dry-runs.

Governance used to be derived three ways: the gateway parsed SQL one way, the
policy dry-run another, and the source-role dry-run not at all - it handed raw
SQL to a connector adapter that never parsed it and reported `db.execute_raw`
on `*` for a plain SELECT. A dry-run that disagrees with the
gateway tells an operator their roles are broken when they are not, or fine
when they are not. Everything that derives a permission request from SQL now
comes through here.

It also resolves table names the way the database does. Every unqualified
table used to become `public.<name>`, which is right only for a PostgreSQL
source whose search path starts with `public`. MySQL has no `public` schema,
so a role written against the real database name never matched; a PostgreSQL
login whose search path starts elsewhere was governed against the wrong
table. The source catalog records each source's search path and tables, so a
bare name resolves to the schema that actually holds it:

- PostgreSQL: the first schema on the scanning login's effective search path
  that holds the table. Schemas earlier on the path become deny-only shadows:
  the catalog can be stale, and a table created there since the last scan would
  win the lookup, so a deny on it must still fire.
- MySQL and MariaDB: the configured database.
- Snowflake: the configured schema, in the configured database. A reference
  into another database is refused rather than guessed at.

A legacy alias keeps roles written before this change working on MySQL and
Snowflake, where every bare name used to read `public.<table>`: allows and
denies are both checked against it, so an old deny cannot silently stop firing.
With no catalog yet, names resolve as they always did.
