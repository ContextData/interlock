    One judgement, consulted by every protocol. The production gate used to
    live inline in `pg_proxy._open_upstream_connection` and was handed only to
    the PG-wire listener, so the connector path - MCP and HTTP - had no
    equivalent check. The same stored source was therefore refused on one
    protocol and served on another, and an operator could satisfy themselves
    that it worked while it was in fact unverified wherever it did connect.

    Returns a message rather than raising, so each caller can raise the error
    type its own surface expects while both report the same wording.

    Only a verifying mode passes in production. `require` encrypts without
    checking the certificate - asyncpg's require with no root.crt sets
    CERT_NONE - and it used to pass here while the PG-wire path, building a
    default verifying context, checked the same source. The refusal message
    promises verified TLS, so the gate now requires exactly that.

    Scope is deliberately PostgreSQL: it judges the `ssl`/`sslmode` and
    `ssl_verify`/`verify_ssl` fields that a database upstream declares. A
    connector that carries none of them - object storage, a SaaS API - has no
    posture to read here and must not be failed for its absence.
