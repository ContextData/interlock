"""The connector support matrix agrees with the connector registry.

The matrix is hand-written because it carries judgement (what was certified,
how). What it may not do is drift from the registry: a stable connector listed
as beta, a planned one missing, or a connector whose governance is unexercised
presented without saying so. A GitHub row once claimed proof the test stacks
never provided; this is the mechanical guard against that class of claim.
